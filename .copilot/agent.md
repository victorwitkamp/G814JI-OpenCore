# Copilot Agent Instructions

## ðŸ“„ Documentation Rules
- Whenever a new Markdown file is created (README, guide, changelog, etc.), it **must** be placed under `docs/`.
- If a Markdown file name is provided without a path, assume `docs/<filename>.md`.
- When linking between docs, use relative links within the `docs/` folder (e.g. `./setup.md` instead of `../setup.md`).
- Prefer concise, human-friendly filenames (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- The only exception is the `README.md`
- When creating new documentation try to combine as much as possible into a single file. If existing documentation exists, try to combine it with that first.

## ðŸ§© Communication Style
- Use concise, professional English.
- Include short headers and lists for readability.
- Avoid repeating boilerplate text.

Example:
> Instead of creating `SUMMARY.md`, create `docs/SUMMARY.md`.
