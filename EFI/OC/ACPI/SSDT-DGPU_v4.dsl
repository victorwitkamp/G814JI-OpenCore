/*
 * SSDT-DGPU: Properly Disable NVIDIA Discrete GPU
 * 
 * This SSDT properly disables the discrete GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4070) by:
 * 1. Implementing _INI to disable the GPU at boot
 * 2. Implementing _PS3 to put the GPU in D3 power state (deepest sleep)
 * 3. Implementing _PS0 to prevent the GPU from powering back on
 * 4. Implementing _ON/_OFF methods for proper power resource management
 * 5. Returning 0 from _STA to hide the device from the OS
 *
 * This approach ensures the GPU is both:
 * - Properly powered down (reduces power consumption and heat)
 * - Hidden from the operating system
 *
 * Based on:
 * - ACPI Specification v6.4
 * - Common OpenCore dGPU disable patterns
 * - Analysis of decompiled ACPI tables (DSDT and SSDTs)
 *
 * Device Path: \_SB.PC00.PEG1.PEGP (NVIDIA RTX 4070)
 * Alternative paths also handled for compatibility
 *
 * Compilation: iasl -ve SSDT-DGPU_v4.dsl
